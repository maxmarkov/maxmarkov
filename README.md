Hi there! 👋 I am a Data Scientist with a strong background in natural sciences and experience researching and productionalizing machine learning projects. I currently work as a data consultant in Brussels, Belgium. This is my personal page containing repositories of projects I work on in my spare time. As a former researcher, I like to delve into things to understand how they work. I also enjoy learning and working with new technological tools!  

My current interests are:

- 🤖 Machine learning: implementing neural networks in PyTorch
- 🐎 MLOps: deploying and maintaining machine learning models
- 📈 Conformal Predictions: an Uncertainty Estimation Algorithm
- 👨‍🔬 Open Data analytics and Data Science for social good 

My techological stack consists of:

- 💻 Programming language: 🐍 Python
